** 002 Human vs AI - 02

*** AI Prompt

Realistic image of programmer sitting in front of many monitors. On left
side of monitors that should be `manual-creative` sentence
visible on screens, and on right side of monitors that should be
`AI-not-creative` sentence visible. Programmer is having dilemma which
to use.

*** Notes

Iteresting that this image is having a human with three hands - that was not something in AI Prompt.

** 003 Sailship VS Spaceship

*** AI Prompt

Realistic image with sailing ship and space ship fighting to each
other on the sea and space. Sea should change to space smoothly. That
should be storm in background.

*** Notes

I have to say that I really like those images (all four of them).

Howver I like the most =003-2= and =003.3= - this is something interesting to see on one picture.

** 010 Dart Vader VS Luke (Flash)

*** AI Prompt

High realistic image of Darth Vader contra Luke Skywaker and visible
force around they fighting. Luke is having lightnings around him
similar like flash the speedster.

*** Notes

- Interesting that first image tried to create Luke (no fully masked) - however rest is purly flash :)
- But anyway - I really loved what was generated.
- I really liked =010-1= and =010-2= (looks like flash stollen light saver from Dath Vader...)
