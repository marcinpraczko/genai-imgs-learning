* General info

** Why I created this page

I've created this project for practicing two activities:

1. Simple Page based on Static Site Generator and publishing (for example: GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, etc).
2. Sharing what I've learned during testing generating Images by =AI=.

** List of images

* Images

** 001 Human vs AI - 01

*** AI Prompt

Realistic image with two sailing ships fighting to each other on the
see. Sky is having storm in background. One ship will have Human logo
on sails and second will have AI logo on sails

[[./img/001-1.jpeg]]

** 002 Human vs AI - 02

*** AI Prompt

Realistic image of programmer sitting in front of many monitors. On left
side of monitors that should be `manual-creative` sentence
visible on screens, and on right side of monitors that should be
`AI-not-creative` sentence visible. Programmer is having dilemma which
to use.

*** Notes

Iteresting that this image is having a human with three hands - that was not something in AI Prompt.

** 003 Sailship VS Spaceship

*** AI Prompt

Realistic image with sailing ship and space ship fighting to each
other on the sea and space. Sea should change to space smoothly. That
should be storm in background.

*** Notes

I have to say that I really like those images (all four of them).

Howver I like the most =003-2= and =003.3= - this is something interesting to see on one picture.
