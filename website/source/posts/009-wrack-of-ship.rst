Those images are amazing, however that was another lesson, to be more specific in prompt
about objects which we are expecting to generate. Initially I was thinking about ``sailing ship``,
however I only mentioned ``ship``. 

.. note::

  - Be specific about objects,
  - If one is not writing in his/her native language, one should translate words correctly before,
    generating image, otherwise result is not what we think about (in my case English -> Polish)


AI Prompt - sailing ship
------------------------
  
  High realistic image of wrack of the sailing ship on the bottom of water


Notes
-----

- Learning of this was that one needs to be specific when asking about object

Notes

- This is still something which amazed me, however I had 'picture in my mind', about sailing ship,
  however I didn't mentioned this in prompt. One more lesson - to be specific
