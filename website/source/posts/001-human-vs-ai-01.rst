Story
-----

I started using **AI** on daily basic in both work and private, and I saw very interesting potential.
However also I've reflect a bit with question: ``Where are we going with this?``.
I've created post on **Linkedin** and wanted generate some image... First image really suprised me.
And this is how I started testing what Generative AI can help with during image generation.
